Implementation of a Deep Q Learning algorithm

This work is largely based on the course of Hadelin de Ponteves and Kirill Emerenko on Udemy: "Artificial Intelligence A-Z"

The goal was to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm powered by a deep network. The implemented model is used to create a working prototype of a self driving car.

Rewards (positive or negative) are given based on a simple objective (go from the upper left side of the screen to the bottom right and vice versa) and through avoiding or not obstacles (which are dinamically drawn by the user).

The final outputs are accessible via this link: https://github.com/florianrougier/deep-q-learning/tree/master/IA-%20Deep%20reinforcement%20learning%20example/videos
